# My Personal Project

## Exercise Training Log

My personal project this term will be the 
development of a training log application.
This application will allow the user to keep a record
of their training on a regular basis.

Each Training session will contain 4 **main** categories
- Type of exercise/training
- Duration of exercise
- Distance
- Workout description

 This application will mainly be meant for 
 athletes who participate in endurance sports, but can
 also be used by the average person.
 
This project is of interest to me because I am an 
endurance athlete myself in the sport of Track & Field, 
and a training log is something I use on a daily basis.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add a workout to my training log
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a workout from my training log
- As a user, I want to be able to give my workouts an effort rating
- As a user, I want to be able to add a description of my workouts
- As a user, I want to be able to save my training log
- As a user, I want to be able to load my previously saved training log

## Phase 4: Task 3 -

My UML diagram is quite simple as my project has few 
relationships between classes, but this is also the area
where I could possibly make a change and refactor my classes.
A change I could possibly make is 
- Splitting GUI class up into multiple classes for each panel

Each of these classes would include an association to a singular training log.
I think by splitting up my GUI class it would help make 
the functionality of each panel within my project more clear.

Aside from that change there is not much else I would consider refactoring
at this point in time and with the coding knowledge I have so far, unless
I was going to add some extra functionality or extended my application
in some way.
