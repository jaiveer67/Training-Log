# My Personal Project

## Exercise Training Log

My personal project this term will be the 
development of a training log application.
This application will allow the user to keep a record
of their training on a regular basis.

Each Training session will contain 4 **main** categories
- Type of exercise/training
- Duration of exercise
- Distance
- Workout description

 This application will mainly be meant for 
 athletes who participate in endurance sports, but can
 also be used by the average person.
 
This project is of interest to me because I am an 
endurance athlete myself in the sport of Track & Field, 
and a training log is something I use on a daily basis.
